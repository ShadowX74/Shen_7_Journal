What is this?:
public void render(GameContainer gc, StateBasedGame sbg, Graphics g)
throws SlickException {

It is a section of code that renders the graphics of your statebasedgame inside the gamecontainer.

Is it a class or method? How do you know?
It is a method, because it says public void, and does not say public Class.
