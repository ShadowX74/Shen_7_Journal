Questions:
GNU was the company that priginally made software fore Linux. I have not seen thsi license before though.
The license is saying that you can change and share the software under the license and does not guarantee that the software works.
The author will not recieive compensation for any of their work, and it can be changed.
The user is not guaranteed software that will necessarily work as they wish it be.
You would use this license when you want to create open source free software and let people be creative with it.
You would not use this license when you want to make money from it and keep the secrets to yourself.
