During / after the holiday, we will be constructing "dungeon crawlers" (or side-scrollers).
Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game. Why?
I would make an RPG where you have to defeat an all powerful rogue mage.
It would have you fight through dark sewers and light fields to get to him.
I believe this would be an interesting game, as well as being fun and challenging to create.
