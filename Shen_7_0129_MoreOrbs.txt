What is a class constructor?
A class constructor is a line of code that creates an instance of a class.

What should be included in a class constructor for orbs? Why?
It should have an x and a y for the orb to spawn, so it can fly from there. It also needs a direction to move, and maybe the damage a certain level of it could cause.

What methods should the orb have? Why?
It should have a move function to fly in a direction, and do damage.
