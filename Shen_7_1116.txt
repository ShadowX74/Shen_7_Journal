No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
Be specific.
I will use methods for each decision in my game, so that I can call each one inside itself in case they input an invalid answer and for better organization.
I also use methods to allow the user to check their stats.

What values will you pass to them?
I currently have not passed any values to them.
