No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
Be specific.
I will use methods for each decision in my game, so that I can call each one inside itself in case they input an invalid answer and for better organization.
I also use methods to allow the user to check their stats.

What values will you pass to them?
I have passd a value to a check method where I compare the user's input to the string I pass to the method.
What exact string I pass depends on the choice the user faces.
