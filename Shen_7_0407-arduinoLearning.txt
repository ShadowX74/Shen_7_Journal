Please describe 3 very specific things you have learned about CS or CS specific problems you have solved working with Arduino.
You should provide AT LEAST 9 sentences worth of detail.

I have learned the value of thoroughly troubleshooting and reevaluation. It is a valuable skill to use when in need of help and do not know what to do.
Simply looking through some parts of the entire whole is not enough to find the error(s), and reevaluation is a much needed operation in much of life.
I have also learned the value of creating separate functions for my code in order to better organize code. It also helps with catching errors and 
backtracking in your code. It helps with outside parties understanding and helping with code comments as well.
Finally, I realize that your partner may have good ideas, and you should listen to their ideas and think over them, even if they may not seem like
the best at first. Communicating with others is a path to a successful working relationship and project(in CS, of course). Combined with problems that 
your partner may have spotted which you did not, they may also provide motivation to you.
