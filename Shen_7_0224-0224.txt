Define a class Rat
public class Rat {
    public int x;
    public int y;
    static public boolean isvisible = true;
    Image currentImage;
    Shape hitbox;
    Image rats = new Image("res/rat.png");

    Rat(int a, int b) throws SlickException {
	this.x = a;
	this.y = b;
	this.hitbox = new Rectangle(a, b, 32, 32);
	this.currentImage = rats;
    }
}

Provide the code to declare and instatiate Rats:

public static Rat rat1, rat2, rat3, rat4, rat5;

rat1 = new Rat(12, 2);
rat2 = new Rat(34, 45);
rat3 = new Rat(56, 11);
rat4 = new Rat(11, 123);
rat4 = new Rat(34, 56);

Explain where the declaration and initialization are placed
The declaration is in the beginning of the class before any of the methods, and the initialization is in the Slick "init" method.

Provide a two-dimensional array that specifies coordinates for five rats
public static int[][] coordinates = { 
	{1,4,7,12,34},
	{435,576,2234,86,1}
};
