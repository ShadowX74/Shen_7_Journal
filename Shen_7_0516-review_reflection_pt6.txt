Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting is changing the datatype of a variable or object. Up-casting is making the datatype more complex. Down-casting is making it less complex.

Give a specific code example for up-casting
int integer = 1;
double trouble;
trouble = integer;

Give a specific code example for down-casting
double bob = 3.1415926525
int i;
i = (int)bob;

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
char a = 'a';
String s = "" + a;

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127. A byte is 8 bits, with each bit being a binary number. Thus, the maximum number of values possible is 255.
If the 1 at the left end is 1, then the numbers begin adding on from -128. Should it be a 0, the value starts from 0.
This is represented by a system called two's compliment.
