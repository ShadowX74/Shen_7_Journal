For what computational reason did you type elf64?
elf64 tells nasm where the file is, and to reformat the file to 64-bit.

Why did you use ld?
ld loads the file.

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
It already made the file executable.

Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.
Post the code in your journal
global _start

        section .text
_start:
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 31
        syscall

        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall
message:
        db      "Hello, my name is Xiangyu Shen", 10


What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?
I had to add more bytes to prevent the text from getting cut off.

Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
No. It is very specific, and has much more syntax. It also requires you to specify all of the commands and run them.

What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
It means that they are closer to the level of machine language. There are fewer steps to translate it to the machine..
