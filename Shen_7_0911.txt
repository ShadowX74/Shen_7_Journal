Explain: What is pseudocode - What is it good for?
More specifically -
Why will we use it?

Pseudocode is false code. It is good for planning out what you are going to do before you begin.
We will use it to plan out our code without actually writing it down in a programming language, in order to get our process down. It will help us write our thoughts and see if they should logically work.
