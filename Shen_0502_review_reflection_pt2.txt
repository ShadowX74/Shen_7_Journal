In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. These will all be tested on the final exam!
What is an array?
An array is a collection of variables that are the same datatype, under one name.

How does one make a simple array of Strings?
String [] myStrings = {"a", "b", "c"};

What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
char[][] map = new char[5][5];

What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
int[][][] moredimensions = new int[3][3][3];

How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
myStrings[2] = "not b";

What is the syntax for a while loop?
while (notWin) {
	if (something) {
		doStuff();
	} else {
		notWin = false;
	}
}

Why use while loops in your game?
We use while loops in our game in order to reiterate a section of code until a certain paramenter is met.

Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
You can use the method that you define it under. i.e. game();

Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
In order to be able to process the input simpler and faster, without having to account for the case the user writes the input in when checking the input.

You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. How? Why?
You should compartmentalize your code in order to organize code and make it easier to identify errors. You create individual methods and pass valuables on 
to methods as necessary. i.e. checkCollison(String a, String b);

What values will you pass across methods? how? why?
I will pass the coordinates of the objects, the user input, and anything else that may be necessary in order for the method to run. I would put it in 
the parenthesis after the method. i.e. checkCollision("1, 2", "2, 3");
