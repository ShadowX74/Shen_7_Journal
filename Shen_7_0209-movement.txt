How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?
Explain and provide specific code.
I will set the movement of the orb dependent on the direction my sprite is facing.

if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.right) {
   orb1.xmove = 10;
   orb1.ymove = 0;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.left) {
   orb1.xmove = -10;
   orb1.ymove = 0;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.up) {
   orb1.xmove = 0;
   orb1.ymove = -10;
} else if (playerguy.sprite == playerguy.down) {
   orb1.xmove = 0;
   orb1.ymove = 10;
}

orb1.setX(orb1.x += orb1.xmove);
orb1.setY(orb1.y += orb1.ymove);
