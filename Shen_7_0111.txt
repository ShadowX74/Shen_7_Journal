What slick game will you create?
I will create a slick game where you need to find keys and escape a castle, then a market, etc, until you reach the end.

What challenges have you faced/are you facing with your slick game?
I have to add keys that will open doors in my game. I will also need to create a shop interface and change the game depending on what item they get 
(May not be implemented if takes too long).
