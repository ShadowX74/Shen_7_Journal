Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet("res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This code sets the "up" animation for the player sprite. It takes the images from the spritesheet specified in the folder path under runningSS.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
It would be unrealistic/unproductive to memorize Slick syntax because Slick is just one way to create a game. What we should be learning is general
applications that can be used outside of a Slick game, such as arrays and Arraylists.

What is an array?
An array is a large collection of data pieces of the same datatype, all under one name.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
int mynumbers[] = {1,2,3,4};

What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList is similar to an array, but is not a fixed size.

How do you make an arraylist?
ArrayList<Class> arrayName = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
I found add(), clear(), and isEmpty().

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
An arraylist doesn't have a fixed size.

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
We can make an String array with different values, such as "low health", "full health", "damaged", and "dead". As the players numerical health, 
defined by an integer, decreases beyond a certain point, the String being displayed changes.
