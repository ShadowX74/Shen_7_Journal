What is the process of creativity?
The process of creativity is how you come up with new, intriguing ideas.

What are the specific steps involved? 
You first need to actively involve yourself in a environment one that allows your mind to think freely.
You need to do a mind-numbing task, such as washing dishes continuously, and let your mind wander.
Let your mind brainstorm ideas, toy with new ideas and come up with new experiments, and even some that build off of other ideas.
One will eventually come forth that seems very ingenious, or something that seems like it will work well.
Once that happens, you can attempt it, and test your idea.
You need to keep refining your idea, one thing at a time, until it is very good at what it's supposed to do.
In the end, you end up with a refined, creative solution.
