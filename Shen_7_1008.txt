What are your tentative thoughts / plans for your art project?
I am going to create a fractal that depends on a number inputed by the user. (Will have a limit for the number)

What might be methods you will use?
I will have a method for each fractal pattern with the position and size depending of variations of the inputed number.
I will also have a method for setting random colors for each further layer.

How might you incorporate a for loop?
I will set a for loop to choose a pattern and a color how many ever times the user entered.

How might you incorporate, if, else if, else?
I will include an if else to check if the entered number is under a certain threshhold.
There will also be an if else chain to check the different fractals.

What math might you use? 
I will use math to create each fractal.
