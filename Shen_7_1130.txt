How successful were you with your game? In what way? Be specific.
I was pretty successful with my game, but not completely so.
I completed my game and storyline, but I would have elaborated on the storyline with more events if I had more time.
I also completed all of the requirements on the rubric, but would have liked to add a few extra credit items.
I used many methods successfully and commented out explanations of my code.
Overall, I was fairly successful with my game.
