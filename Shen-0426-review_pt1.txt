	return a*a*a;
}

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student
public class Student {
	int homework = 0;
	int grades = 100;

		this.homework = a;
		this.grades = b;
	}
}

Student name;
name = new Student(3, 96);

Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
I would create a program with a soft potentiometer to emit a different pitch depending on how close a person was. This intrigues me, because it could be used to 
deter people form dangerous locations in real life.
