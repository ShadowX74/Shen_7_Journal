We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
Yes, I am ready, though I may have to study a bit.

What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
My name is Xiangyu Shen and I'm awesome.

We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
I will have to add more states for the level and inventory, as well as setting up an array for the traps similar to the blocked array. I already have the enemies,
and damage, and I just have to add a running tally for enemies killed.

Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? 
If not be specific. 
I am not prepared to do all of it, becasue I need to examine the existing states to understand what is needed. I will also need to examine the blocked class to help
me make the traps.
