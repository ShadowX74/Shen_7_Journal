The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays.
Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why?
Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently).

I was among the former. Two-dimensional arrays are fairly distinctive, and I have a good memory. We are also learning Ruby in Concepts
of Engineering, and I came upon two-dimensional arrays briefly.

Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. 
E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
1. What is a two-dimensional array?
2. How you create one?
3. Does the x, or the y come first?
4. Why?
5. How does one create a class constructor?
6. Why would one not declare an object in the class?
7. What is the difference between declaration and initialization?
8. What purpose does a nested for loop serve?
9. What does static do for a variable?
10. How would you access the 5th objects in the 4th array of a two-dimensiona array?
