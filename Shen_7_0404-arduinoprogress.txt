Describe the progress you have made on your project.
What have you done?
We have coded a string of lights that go back and forth, which stops at the press of a button.

What do you need to do?
We need to set up the sounds and try to get the uploads to our arduino working. Also our win and lose methods, which include changing the delay interval.

What will you be able to turn in on Friday?
Hopefully, our working project. If we can get the upload to work, then the coding should be done soon.

What code changes are you writing?
We are coding in methods, a while loop, a button, an RGB LED, 8 other RGBs, and a buzzer.

What functions have you created?
We have created a 'oneWay' and an 'otherWay' method to cycle the lights. Then there is a 'delaying' method to set the delay. We also have individual methods 
to turn on each of the lights, as well as each color of the RGB.
