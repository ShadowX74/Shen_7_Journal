Are you? Why or why not?
No, because my computer was broken for three days.

Describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
I started checking out different types of art, and settled on fractals.

Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
Yes, I did.

Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
Yes, I have to get ideas, but it was not what I wanted.

Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
    for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
        drawRedSquare(gc);
    }

    private void drawRedSquare(GraphicsContext gc) {
        gc.setFill(Color.RED);
        Random rand = new Random();
        int  y1 = rand.nextInt(240);
        int  x1 = rand.nextInt(240);
        int  side = rand.nextInt(20);
        gc.fillRect(y1, x1, side, side);
    }
