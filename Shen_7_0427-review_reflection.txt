The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
CS encourages students to not only regurgitate knowledge, but to analyze that knowledge for patterns and apply those learnings to problems. This is the essence
of high level learning, and is necessary for CS.

What should students learn from CS?
Studets should learn time management and how to problem solve. They should be able to hone analytical skills and learn to apply knowledge.
