What is a method?
A method is like a clay mold that you can make many copies from.

Which methods did you use and how did you use them in your guessing game program?
I used an 'intro' and 'exit' method to introduce people to the game and say bye. I also had the game method where I combined my other methods.
I also had different methods, such as 'diffiulty' one to ask the user for their prefered difficulty and and one to ask for their names.
Other methods asked for them to guess a number, checked the number with the pregenerated one from another method, checked if they were within the given tries,
and asked them is they wanted to play again.

What is a while loop?
A while loop keeps doing what you tell it to do over and over as long as the piece of information you give it stays true.

How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game?
I used a while loop in the main section of my code, so that the game kept on running as long as the user wanted to play again, which was a boolean.
I used a counter for the tries left and the tries used.
